# Technical Analysis: AI Story Generator

## System Architecture Overview

The AI Story Generator is a sophisticated Python-based application designed to generate novel-length stories using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system employs a multi-stage pipeline architecture with distinct components for outline generation, chapter creation, and scene development.

### Key Architectural Features

- **Modular Design**: The system is built with clear separation of concerns, organizing functionality into distinct modules for outline generation, chapter creation, scene handling, and model interfaces.
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Story generation follows a sequential pipeline from outline to chapters to scenes, with quality control at each stage.
- **Flexible Model Configuration**: Supports multiple LLM providers (Ollama, Google, OpenRouter) with configurable parameters for each generation stage.
- **Quality Control System**: Implements iterative revision cycles with automated quality checks and feedback loops.
